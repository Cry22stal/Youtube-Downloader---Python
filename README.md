# Youtube-Downloader---Python
This small project, conists of only one .py file.
I have created this project just to download videos/audios from Youtube and get them saved in my computer..
I have used pytube library to download the files with some custom coding and modifications.

How to use:
          1. Just Go with the flow.
          2. Run the code in python console.
          3. Copy a link from youtube of your own choice and paste in the console when prompted.
          4. Choose whether you need Audio or Video+Audio
          5. The program will return all the available download streams which fit your choices and display the quality and type of the available streams.
          6. Select any of the streams.
          7. It will start downloading straight away.
          8. If you have downloaded an audio file and it's file extension is not .mp3, the program will ask you to change the type of the file to mp3..
             you can either type Yes/yes or No/no accordingly and the program will work accordingly as well.
          9. The download location has been printed in the console by the time you're busy doing this. 
          10. I would really appreciate if you mention the credits to me wherever applicable <3
Happy Coding!
